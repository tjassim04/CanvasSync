-------------------------

CanvasSync helps students automatically synchronize modules, assignments & files located on their
institutions Canvas web server to a mirrored folder on their local computer.

Usage
-----
$ canvas.py [-S] <sync> [-h] <help> [-s] <reset settings> [-i] <show current settings>
    [-p {password}] <specify password>

    -h [--help], optional                : Show this help screen.

    -S [--sync], optional                : Synchronize with Canvas

    -s [--setup], optional               : Enter settings setup screen.

                                           The first time CanvasSync is launched settings must be set. Invoking
                                           CanvasSync with the -s or --setup flags will allow the user to reset
                                           these settings.

    -i [--info], optional                : Show currently active settings.

    -p {password}, optional              : Specify settings file decryption password (potentially dangerous)

    -t [--threads] {number}, optional    : Specify the number of threads to use for synchronization (default: 1)

Setup
-----
CanvasSync requires at least the following settings to be set:

- A path pointing to a local folder. This folder will store the synced files and folders.
- A Canvas web server URL.
- An authentication token (see https://github.com/perslev/CanvasSync for details)
- A list of courses that should be synchronized.

CanvasSync will guide you through these settings during the first time launch. Alternatively,
the settings may be reset using the -s or --setup flag. See below.
